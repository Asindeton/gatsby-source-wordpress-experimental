# Incremental Builds

Incremental builds mean that only changed posts are rebuilt on content changes from WordPress.

When you're using [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), inc-builds will work by default! :zap:

There are no other other services which can provide incremental builds, wether they claim to or not.

You can expect inc-build times between 4 - 12 seconds depending on your setup.

See [Willit.build](https://willit.build/details/type/blog/source/wordpress/page-count/8192) for historical incremental build time benchmarking data!
