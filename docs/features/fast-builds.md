# Fast Builds

Due to our [WPGatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/wp-gatsby) WordPress plugin, we can do very aggressive caching. This means that even without incremental builds your build times will be on fire :fire:

You can expect to see massively faster build times than previous versions of `gatsby-source-wordpress`. The actual cached build time will vary depending on the size and complexity of your Gatsby site/app, but it will be in the ballpark of 1 minute for a ~1000 page site.
