# Caching

- After the first build or run of develop only changed data is pulled.
- If the remote schema changes between builds, the entire cache will be invalidated and the plugin will start a fresh pull/build.
- The cache isn't selectively invalidated for every possible user interaction.
- For now it only works for the following events:
  - Users:
    - creating
    - updating
    - deleting
    - reattributing posts
    - creating/deleting based on wether the user becomes public/private
  - Pages/Posts/CPT's
    - creating
    - deleting
    - drafting
    - updating
  - Media Items
    - editing
    - creating
    - deleting
  - Categories/Terms/Tags
    - creating
    - editing
    - deleting
- The following events will not yet properly update the cache:
  - Changing the home/blog page
  - Changing permalink structure
  - Saving any WP options
  - Saving ACF options
